                    The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 (FCA, 1980) is an act by the Parliament of India which ensures conservation of forest and its resources. It was enacted by the Parliament of India in order to control the ongoing deforestation of the forests of India. It came into force on October 25, 1980 containing five sections. Amid news reports mentioning future amendments to the FCA 1980 by the Environment Ministry, the act and its provisions become important from the current affairs perspective.

                    <p id="defination">NEED FOR THE FOREST CONSERVATION ACT, 1980</p>
                    • Forests are an important resource that nature can bestow upon mankind. Therefore, it is the duty of every citizen to preserve the ecosystems of forests. But due to rapid deforestation, the cycle of nature is itself being disrupted. Therefore, the need to bring about a law to ensure the preservation of forest was needed.
                    <br>
                    • The act gave authority to the British to restrict tribal activities by levying taxes on timber and forest services. In other words, it mainly regulated the cutting of timber and flow of raw materials rather than protecting forests.<br><br>

                    <p id="defination">OBJECTIVES</p>
                    • The aim of the Forest is to preserve the forest ecosystem of India by fulfilling the following objectives:<br>1.

                    3. Prevent forest lands being converted into agricultural, grazing or for any other commercial purposes and intentions.<br><br>
